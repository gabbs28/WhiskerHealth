Prisma folder is not directly used it contains the directives to build the client (schema.prisma file) 
also contains migrations and a seeder file

I need the prisma client for the backend as well as prisma client enumerations in the frontend for my dropdowns

It doesn't make sense to locate the prima folder in the backend directory as it isn't the client and
since i need the client for both the backend and frontend. i don't want nor does it make sense to have
duplicate directives as that would create a higher maintance burden

the project isn't set up to use workspaces so I can't create a package containing the client to be imported 
by the backend and frontewnt which would be ideal. also backend is using cjs (require / old) and the frontend is
using esm (import / new) and I am not sure if is possible to create a dual purpose module (also not sure how
to do that as I new to TS) 

this project is setup like a monorepo without all the required instrumentation (why I trying to use nx in my 
first attempt since i don't know how to do all that myself) as such i have the prisma folder broken out and
have it generate a client for the backend using cjs and the frontend using esm to achive my goal of using it
in both places.

this isn't ideal but i feel that my rational behind this choice is sound.
